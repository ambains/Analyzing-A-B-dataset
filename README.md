# Analyzing-A-B-dataset
Analysis of a dataset with A/B test results for a website 


A/B testing is a widely used technique employed by data analysts and scientists. It is a method of comparing two versions of a website feature - the new design versus the old - to determine which version yields the desired outcomes, such as increased user engagement or higher sales. This analysis is relevant for e-commerce websites. The required libraries for this project are pandas, numpy, random, matplotlib.pyplot and statsmodels.api.
